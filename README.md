# MPD Display

A moOde audio / Volumio / MPD client designed to show current track information on a cheap tablet such that it can be easily read across a room.

## Getting Started

Do you use a Raspberry Pi (or other computer running MPD) as a music player? Do you miss being able to glance at what's currently playing without using your computer or phone? Are you uninterested or incapable of adding an LCD display or touchscreen case to your RPi? Do you have an unused tablet lying around, or can you afford a cheap tablet like the Kindle Fire?

MPD Display provides a minimalist display of what's currently playing using text that is big enough to read across a room. It also provides basic playback controls. It is intended to be positioned on your stereo equipment rack, and talks to the MPD server inside your music player to fetch the current track information. The tablet can also be connected to your RPi via a USB cable to keep it charged and to allow the RPi to turn on and unlock the screen automatically when playback starts. (That part is a little technical but instructions are provided.)

MPD Display is free of charge and open-source.
