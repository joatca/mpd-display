# MPD Display

A moOde audio / Volumio / MPD client designed to show current track information on a cheap tablet such that it can be easily read across a room.

## Getting Started

MPD Display is a "now playing" display for the [moOde audio player](https://moodeaudio.org/), other similar Raspberry-Pi-based music players, or any computer running the [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/). It is intended to be used on a cheap/old/unused Android tablet and to be easily readable at variety of distances. Below is a screenshot, however it looks much cooler when the tablet is on top of your stereo cabinet!

MPD Display provides a minimalist display of what's currently playing using text that is big enough to read across a room. It also provides basic playback controls. It is intended to be positioned on your stereo equipment rack, and talks to the MPD server inside your music player to fetch the current track information. The tablet can also be connected to your RPi via a USB cable to keep it charged and to allow the RPi to turn on and unlock the screen automatically when playback starts. (That part is a little technical but instructions are provided.)

MPD Display is free of charge and open-source.
